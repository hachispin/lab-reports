# lab-reports

This repository is used to store any programs used for my A-level Physics practicals.

## Requirements

Languages:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | version: ^3.14.2

Libraries:
- [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) | version: ^2.3.5
- [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) | version: ^3.10.8

You may not need these exact versions, but I can't guarantee stability
on older versions or versions with breaking changes (change in MAJOR).
